<p><font size="2"><font family="Montserrat" font color="#000000"><p>The body's responses to psychological threats, and those that accompany efforts to cope with them, include changes in the autonomic nervous system and in cardiovascular activity that, over time, contribute to the development of heart disease.  Certain of these biological responses also provide a window into the cognitive and affective processing of threats, and psychological underpinnings of coping behavior.  They also may serve as markers to identify individuals who are at risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety disorders.  The concept of psychological stress plays an important role as a framework for understanding these phenomena, as do theories of emotion and motivation.  Current projects include:

<p>
1.  Psychophysiology of Gender-Related Threat:  How do stressful events associated with one's gender-related beliefs affect the autonomic and cardiovascular systems? How do people cope with these events? Do physiological and behavioral effects of these events increase the risk of heart disease?
</p>
<p><font size="2"><font family="Montserrat" font color="#000000"><p>
2.  Psychophysiology of Trauma Exposure:  What are the biological effects of recalling and recounting a traumatic experience?  Do those responses identify individuals at risk for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder?

3.  Electrocortical Measurement of Threat Sensitivity:  Can measurement of the brainâ€™s spontaneous electrical activity (electroencephalography, or EEG) help us to identify individuals who are especially sensitive to certain forms of threat, and predict how they will cope? Can electrocortical responses to threat-related stimuli (event-related potentials, or ERP) shed light on cognitive, affective, and social processes activated by psychological threat?
