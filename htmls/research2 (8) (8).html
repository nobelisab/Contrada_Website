<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Beliefs about social groups have important implications for health. Perceived attributes of men and women, and of members of racial/ethnic groups and group members, can promote prejudice and discrimination, major forms of psychological stress. Beliefs about physical and mental health problems influence decisions to seek medical care or psychotherapy, and may undermine adherence to evidence-based treatments. Among the conceptual frameworks that facilitate the investigation of these phenomena are those involving precarious manhood and psychological essentialism, and stereotype-related processes such as subtyping and subgrouping. Current projects include:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br><strong>1. Stereotypes and Parental Status: What stereotypes are associated with parental status, especially that of being childless by choice? What are the differential effects of childless-by-choice status on how men and women are perceived? What are the implications of these stereotypes for the evaluation of social targets with different parental statuses?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><br></strong>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>2. Causal Beliefs about Depression: How do essentialist beliefs about depression influence expectations about its course, severity, and treatability? What are the effects of essentialist thinking about depression on stigmatizing attitudes toward those with this disorder? Can causal network analysis shed light on the structure and content of individual's lay models of depression? How are those models influenced by experience with one's own depression or that of friends and family members?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><br></strong>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>3. Relational Schemas Associated With Racism: Experiences of racial discrimination shape schemas for thinking about relationships with others. Discrimination has been linked to relational schemas involving vigilance, hostility, rejection sensitivity, and stereotype confirmation concerns. Are these relational schemas each uniquely related to discriminatory experiences? Or do they form overlapping constructs? How are they organized?</span></p>
